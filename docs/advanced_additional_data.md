# Advanced VAT and ID number handling for .es and .pt



WHMCS uses a straightforward paradigm for collecting additional domain information or additional contact information when registering domains. The usual case is for additional data to be provided at the domain creation stage by the end user. That additional data is connected with the WHMCS domain object and if domain registration is triggered by WHMCS, this additional data is used by the registrar module, in this case, Openprovider. 

While this method works in in the simplest case, it fails in cases where the end user wants to change the additional data after the domain has already been registered. In this case, the end user must contact the WHMCS administrator, who must update the data in the Openprovider control panel. 

In the case of .es and .pt domains, the end user must supply some form of tax id, whether they are a corporate entity or private individual. The advanced option for  .es and .pt domains allows this particular piece of data to be tied directly to the end user object in WHMCS, and when the domain

#### Updating a domain with the additional data
